# ARM-Based-SoC-System-On-Chip-design-Course-Tutorial-Using-Cortex-M0-Processor
This web course is about Designing a System on Chip using ARM's Cortex-M0 processor. All the material needed for this tutorial i.e. Tools &amp; RTL Source Code/C&amp;Assembly Source Code is either available on this repository or can be obtained free of charge from various companies. See the 'Tutorial Resources' section below to get these.  This SoC design Tutorial will be posted on this repository in Stages. The First Stage of this course is now complete and is available. The idea is to learn how to design a System on Chip from scratch. The First Stage, i.e. Stage 1 is about building a very simplistic SoC with a processor and 2 memories. With each stage, more components will be added to make the SoC more capable, and feature-rich. The processor chosen for the SoC is ARM's Cortex-M0 processor. This is because the RTL for this processor is now available free of charge from ARM's web site to everyone, along with the RTL of other critical components that are used in this web-course. Again follow the links under 'Tutorial Resources' to get it. The course won't go into the details of the processor itself, as there are plenty of websites that will enable the user/reader to get a basic idea of this processor. The course rather focuses on its main objective i.e. SoC design.
